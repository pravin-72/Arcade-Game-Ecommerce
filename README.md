# Arcade Game Ecommerce - Basic UX Design Project

## Description

Welcome to my Arcade Game Ecommerce UX Design project! This is my first attempt at UX Design, and I am excited to present a basic design concept for an Arcade Game Ecommerce platform. Throughout this project, I utilized Figma and Adobe XD as my design tools, drawing from the experience gained during the completion of the Google UX Design certificate.

## Design Overview

The Arcade Game Ecommerce design aims to create a user-friendly and visually engaging platform for gamers to discover, purchase, and explore various arcade games. The goal is to provide an enjoyable and seamless user experience, combining elements of gaming aesthetics with modern e-commerce functionality.

## Key Features

1. **Homepage:** A captivating landing page that welcomes users with an attractive banner showcasing popular arcade games, featured promotions, and calls-to-action for easy navigation.

2. **Game Categories:** Intuitive category sections that help users explore different game genres, making it effortless to find their favorite games.

3. **Game Details:** A detailed game page presenting comprehensive information about each game, including descriptions, screenshots, ratings, and user reviews.

4. **Shopping Cart:** A streamlined shopping cart feature allowing users to add games, review their selections, and proceed to checkout with ease.

5. **User Profiles:** User accounts with personalized profiles where gamers can track their order history, wishlist, and manage their preferences.

## Design Tools

- Figma: Used for wireframing, prototyping, and collaborative design iterations.
- Adobe XD: Utilized for high-fidelity mockups and interactive design elements.
